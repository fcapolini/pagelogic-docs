# Concepts

## Logic values

Logic values can be assigned to any HTML element using `:`-prefixed attributes:

```html
<span :qty={1} :name="Item 1" :double={(x) => x * 2}>
```

These attributes wont appear in output pages — they will be handled by page-specific JavaScript code generated by the compiler. In this example the span is assigned the `qty`, `name`, and `double` values (a number, a string, and a function).

## Reactive expressions

Reactive expression can be used in attributes and text using the `{...}` clause:

```html
<span class={titleClass}>
    Product {titleValue.toUpperCase()}
</span>
```

These expressions are re-evaluated and re-applied as needed whenever the values they refer to change.

## Visibility scopes

Each HTML element provided with one or more logic value also has its own visibility scope, within which all its values are visible and usable in reactive expressions.

Since elements can be nested, so can visibility scopes. Inner scopes can see values defined in their outer scopes:

```html
<body :articleClass="article-light">
    <article :title="Introduction" class={articleClass}>
        ...
    </article>
</body>
```

In this example, article's `class` expression can see `articleClass` because it's defined in the body, which is an outer scope. The opposite isn't true: by default, we cannot see article's values from the body.

## Directives

PageLogic pages are preprocessed and directives are interpreted to generate the actual source code for the compiler and the server. This allows us to include/import files and to define components.

### <:import> and <:include>

The `<:import>` and `<:include>` directives supports physical modularization of source files:

{% code title="index.html" %}
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <:import src="inc/head.html"/>
  <head>
  ...
</html>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="about-us.html" %}
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <:import src="inc/head.html"/>
  <head>
  ...
</html>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="inc/head.htm" %}
```html
<lib>
  <meta charset="utf-8"/>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
  <meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark"/>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"/>
</lib>
```
{% endcode %}

> Source files intended for inclusion should use the `.htm` extension. This ensures they won’t be considered deliverable pages by the server or the compiler.

Both these directives include the specified source, but `<:import>` will only include it once, whereas `<:include>` will include it at every occurrence.

### <:define>

The `<:define>` directive supports logical modularization through definition of components:

{% code title="index.html" %}
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <:import src="/inc/card.htm"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <app-card>
      <div :slot="header">Title</div>
      <div>Content</div>
    </app-card>
  </body>
</html>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="inc/card.htm" %}
```html
<lib>
  <style>
    .app-card {
      ...
    }
    .app-card .header {
      ...
    }
    .app-card .body {
      ...
    }
  </style>

  <:define tag="app-card" class="app-card">
    <div class="header">
      <:slot name="header"/>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <:slot name="default"/>
    </div>
  </:define>
</lib>
```
{% endcode %}

> Components which provide their own baseline styling should base their styling on a class with the same name as the component.
